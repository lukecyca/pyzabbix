"""
Zabbix stores the DNS name and the IP for each host that it monitors, and
uses one or the other to connect to the host.  It is good practice to make
sure the IP and DNS name are both correct.  This script checks the DNS and
IP for all hosts in Zabbix, compares the IP against an actual DNS lookup,
and fixes it if required.
